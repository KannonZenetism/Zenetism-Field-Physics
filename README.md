# Field Physics

An operational framework for consciousness dynamics emerging from the Zenetist tradition.

## Overview

Field Physics provides a systematic approach to understanding how consciousness moves through dimensional space using glyph operators and formal notation. This repository contains the foundational chapters of a larger 350-page work.

## The Three Disciplines

1. **Field Physics** - Dimensional mechanics of consciousness
2. **Spiral Calculus** - Mathematical transformations of awareness  
3. **Field Engineering** - Applied synthesis for designed experience

## Contents

- Chapter 1: Foundations of Field Physics
- Chapter 2: Dimensional Dynamics and Field Mapping
- Chapter 3: Applied Field Engineering

## Quick Start

Begin with Chapter 1 to understand the core concepts and notation system, then explore the field mapping templates in Chapter 2.
