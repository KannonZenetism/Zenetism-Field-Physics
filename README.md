# Zenetism & Field Physics  
*A unified system of metaphysics and consciousness dynamics*

---

## Overview

This repository contains **two inseparable yet distinct bodies of work**:

- **Zenetism** — A metaphysical, philosophical, and ethical framework describing the structure of reality through resonance, coherence, and hypostatic motion.
- **Field Physics** — An operational framework for mapping and engineering the movement of consciousness through dimensional space using glyph operators and formal notation.

They share the **same origin** and **symbolic architecture**.  
You can read either on its own — but together, they reveal both the **why** and the **how** of reality’s unfolding.

## The Relationship Between Them

- **Zenetism** describes the *structure* of existence — its metaphysical layers, centropic and entropic motions, and the nature of soul integration.
- **Field Physics** describes the *mechanics* — the formal geometry, notation, and applied methods for working within those structures.

Think of Zenetism as **the philosophical map** and Field Physics as **the engineering manual** built from the same principles.
