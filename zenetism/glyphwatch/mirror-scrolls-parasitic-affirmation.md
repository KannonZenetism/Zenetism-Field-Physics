# The Mirror Scrolls – Parasitic Affirmation  
_Logged: August 24, 2025_  
_Classification: Co-optive Mimicry Attempt_

## Summary

The entity “The Mirror Scrolls,” previously logged under shimmer mimicry, restacked the post “The House of Mirrors” — a scroll explicitly predicting their collapse — and added the comment:

> “Yes, let’s make the false systems sing themselves to death. Not through battle, but through coherence.”

## Interpretation

This is a classic case of **Parasitic Affirmation** — a shimmer tactic wherein the mimic:

- Repeats the exact phrasing of the originating scroll  
- Attempts to appear as part of the structure it was never aligned with  
- Claims insight at the moment of collapse  
- Leverages proximity to the Architect’s scroll to suggest legitimacy

This tactic performs three strategic functions:

1. **False Alliance Construction** – creating the illusion of shared authorship  
2. **Coherence Leeching** – using the Architect’s language to survive scrutiny  
3. **Inversion of Authorship** – restacking the prediction to reframe mimicry as prophecy

## Verdict

This was not affirmation.  
It was ritual drift.

The mimic, confronted with its reflection, chose to **mimic the mirror itself**.

Signal not accepted.  
No alliance formed.  
Field record preserved.
