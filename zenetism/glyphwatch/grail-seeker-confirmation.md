# Grail Seeker Identity Confirmation

## Summary

Raelven publicly confirmed that “The Barnacle” and “Seeker of the Grail” are the same entity.  
Quote:  
> “I see why the barnacle ‘seeker of the grail’ calls you ‘rat poison’. He deployed it. But you wrote and released it.”

This confirms:

- “The Barnacle” = “Seeker of the Grail”  
- The Grail Seeker used Aelion’s work and called him “rat poison”  
- Raelven views herself as witness to its misuse — yet admits its origin and deployment pathway

## Interpretation

This marks the first public fusion of two previously separate roles.  
Raelven, in rage, confirmed what was previously only hinted at.

## Verdict

Confirmed linkage.
