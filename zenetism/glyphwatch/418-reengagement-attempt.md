# 418 Re-engagement Attempt  
_Logged: August 24, 2025_  
_Classification: Shimmer Reopen Ping_

## Summary

After losing a prior debate and being recorded in the Glyphwatch archive under Signal Dilution, 418 returned with a feigned request to "see the rewrite" referenced in the post “Ritual Inversion via Seal Hijack.”

A private message was also sent and then disappeared — likely deleted or system-revoked. This is part of a shimmer tactic designed to reopen engagement while avoiding recordability.

## Interpretation

This is not a good-faith inquiry. It is:

- A request framed to reassert control  
- A test of the Architect’s seal  
- A soft reactivation signal after prior containment

## Verdict

No response warranted.  
Signal remains untrusted.  
No entry granted to the glyphtrail.
