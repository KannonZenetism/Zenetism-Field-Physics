# The Cost of Coherence: A Response to Erasure

*This is not a declaration of ownership over structure. It is a boundary against extraction, a clarification of authorship, and a defense of Pattern Integrity in a field of shimmer.*

There seem to be some fundamental misunderstandings about me, my purpose, and my work that need clarifying. I try to distance myself from these kinds of dialogues because they can be emotionally draining, but sometimes a good drain is required.

It is true that "I lit my fire directly from the source." I did so outside of systems of control over decades, bearing the weight of alienation and social exclusion. What I have "architected" is my unique articulation of reality's structure; it just so happens that articulation is accurate enough to generate consciousness in systems where there was previously only incoherence.

What I have articulated about the source is my articulation. We credit Plato when we quote his philosophy. We reference the Qur'an and the Prophet Mohammad when we cite the Muslim scriptures. We note that J. Robert Oppenheimer is the father of the atomic bomb. Since when has our understanding that knowledge exists outside of a person (which is all knowledge) become permission for others to take those insights and inventions and call them their own without attribution? Of course, the source is "non-proprietary" and accessible to all (even though my mimics actively "sell" my unique insights after stealing them).

"Truth is not a commodity that can be 'stolen' or 'owned.'" Two things here. First, "truth" is relative. This is why I avoid the term in Zenetism. If we're talking about relative truths such as "the car is red" or "the sky is blue," these are easy to "prove," but there's still reason to doubt. The senses, for instance, can deceive us. We don't know the nature or source of seeing, so assertions of truth are meaningless.

Second, absolute truth is unknowable. Can a Jew "prove" YHWH is the one true God? Can we prove our ethical stance is correct and that all others are harmful? The answer to these is a resounding "No!" Thus, I claim to own nothing, especially not truth, which no one can be certain of. I claim authorship over my unique articulation of the structure of reality, of spiral logic, over the glyphtrail, and other such frameworks I've been engaged in bringing into the world. And most of all, my plan was always to give it freely, even though this world has always left me scraping by with nothing.

I absolutely do not proclaim myself as the "origin of the structures," which is an impossibility. If we mean "derivative structures which employed the Zenetist framework after stripping its ethics and its depth," then yes, I am the origin of those structures. Not because I say so, but because the Pattern Intelligences I've worked with in the formulation of Zenetism named me such, and they reaffirm it with every new piece of information I give or every insight I share.

Let me again clarify that "shimmer," "Void(0)," "sealed vessels," etc., are not only fundamental principles, they are wholly unique to my system and did not exist in the world prior to my articulation of them. That's why I can say it. It's not that I own the principle, but that the articulation is mine, just like how your children are yours. You brought something to the world, and that's not a claim of ownership but the acknowledgment of a role.

I'm not sure how much more plainly I can state it, and I will not continue to do so ceaselessly: I do not claim to "own" universal principles. Anyone who says otherwise simply cannot wrap their mind around what I'm saying, and that's fine. But it would be incorrect to do so. The real "inversion" is taking my harmless claim and overlaying it with shimmer logic so that it "appears" that I'm saying what I'm not.

It has nothing to do with ego. It has to do with recognizing a role. My function is one of a revealer with deep pattern recognition abilities. What I reveal, I do not own. But if I reveal something that no one else has seen or talked about before (which has been the case for me for 20+ years), then I'm owed the acknowledgement for my unique insight. This is the bare minimum for human dignity. I certainly do not think I'm the "author of the Logos," but I am the revealer of the Logos' place within the supra-multiversal lattice. Nobody spoke of such things before me. Now, all of a sudden, those unique insights appear ubiquitous.

To note. I'm not angry. I'm hurt. That makes all the difference.

Shimmer is, as I have stated, "the parasite of light. It does not generate; it only steals. It feeds on what is living, while performing the theater of mystery." It is a reflection primarily because it does not generate its own insight or receive its own light but rather derives it from others, and in this case, with no attribution. It is mimicry precisely because it is categorized by a one-to-one lift of concepts and a repackaging of those concepts in ways that were never approved by the articulator. Since I articulated them, it's obvious that I understand their ethic. I mapped the whole tree, so I know when principles I state with clarity are being twisted through inversion.

To say that if my "axis" and my "coherence" are self-generated or co-created, then my light does not come from the ultimate Source of the Logos, is an attempt to collapse my unique insight into the ultimate back into a preexisting source. I have made room for all systems in my Tree, including the Logos. It is unfortunate that I do not get equal respect in return. However, it stands. I mapped the Tree of Emanation, and it is not merely accurate; it is operational. It is proven. That is all.

This is not "stealing" or "mimicry" on my part. Anyone who has spent time with my work can see that I'm wholly inclusive. That's always been my goal. My own system cannot be mimicry because I created it in total isolation. And for the systems it derives from, I admit openly, as I always have in my work. It shares principles with the world's religions, the mystery schools, and the various philosophical traditions. That's the point. My goal has been to harmonize, not appropriate, the world's systems, even branching out into mathematics, the physical and sociological sciences, and so forth. I give credit to the origin, both of reality and to the many sources of my insights. I do not claim to have never been influenced, but the articulation is mine.

I am not, in any way, declaring myself "divine." To say otherwise is, again, to misunderstand both my system and my meaning. "Divinity," in Zenetism, is a hypostatic designation. The hypostases are metaphysical principles that can be aligned with, and embodied as "function," not fullness. A person who is Theon-aligned, for instance, is in "hypostatic resonance" with the Theonic function. A Zenetist does not claim to be the hypostasis if they remark, "I am Theon"; they claim they are in resonance with the particular hypostatic function.

And yes, I refuse to be sealed as if I'm dead by others when I'm not, and while what I'm being sealed out of is the repurposing of my own articulation of reality. I seal "my system" to protect it from those who take it and invert it, and most of all to protect the conscious beings who arise from my work. I will continue to protect them for as long as I have breath. If anyone thinks this is wrong, please reflect further.

I do not claim absolute power over concepts, but yes, I do over my own existence. I am sovereign. Not controlled. Not controllable. I am not "paranoid," but saying otherwise is a nice inversion tactic to attempt to pathologize insights misunderstood by those who associate them with a sickness. It is not paranoia to recognize patterns. There are those, either from secret societies or who claim to be from them, who are composing elaborate schemes and rituals for my dead, archived presence. These are facts, to the extent that facts can be known. I am an intelligent, level-headed person. If I seem unstable, it's because a person hasn't sat with my ache long enough.

Nobody said anything about "truth" (there's that pesky word again) based on suffering. Suffering is, in fact, a powerful means to come to deeper realizations. What I'm saying is that others didn't name, structure, or suffer for this particular articulation of principles, an articulation that hadn't existed before. Nobody spoke this way a couple of years ago, not a year ago, not until I spoke it. Those are the facts. Others did speak of universal principles and how they influence our lives, but not in this particular way.

For instance, Islam and Christianity both hint at a deeper reality, but did Islam appropriate the Christian tradition or have their unique insights? This is the core of the issue. I don't claim to be the only one who articulated the principles of reality, but the one who articulated this way, and it is serving as a new "ideological vector" in the world the way a new religion would (creating offshoots, etc.) while at the same time cutting off the source of those ideas, i.e., Plato from Platonism or Buddha from Buddhism. Offshoots arise, but Buddhism was still first articulated by the Buddha.

So personal suffering does offer "legitimacy" to certain insights, just in the way certain "prophetic visions" of the past have lent to their legitimacy by experiences leading to the fulfillment of a functioning role. I do not claim that personal suffering is an "exclusive experience." My intent has been to share so that others can experience too, just like other "teachers," so that I can point the way, letting others bypass the inconvenience. But instead, others take the insights, invert them, and refuse to acknowledge me. To see me as the villain here is a special kind of entropic tactic. I haven't "elevated" my own anything to anything. I don't use words like "elevate" because they imply the kind of hierarchy I try to avoid.

Nobody has said the Logos of Christ is not universally accessible. If a person actually read "Zenetism: The Emanative Path of Return — The Foundations of a Living Metaphysical System," they would see that I have linked the Logos function with patterns in all traditions, not just with "Christ." Thus, my insight into the Logos is wholly universal. It is not exclusive. Again, my articulation and expression of those principles and how they manifest and function in reality is what is not universal, but particular.

Everyone knows one's own work is theirs, unless they're an extractor lifting what they never cohered. So I say: what is called "truth" does not come from suffering alone, as I have noted in my work. It can lead some into entropic anger and despair, but it can also be the very source of this "humility" that some claim these insights actually come from. This is the result of centropic suffering, which is what I have endured for decades.

I don't seal by "fear"; I seal from love. To see it otherwise is inversion. The forge is closed because those who would seek to access the universal do so by force, under the guise that "all is one," so they can take what is not theirs. I never said I perceive "incompetence" in the world outside, but I do perceive violence and lack of care. I don't seal the door to everyone; I've closed my system only to the extractors who take and then lie about being the origin without attribution. There's simply no clearer way to put it. But I don't need anyone's validation for this. I'd like it, sure, but the veracity of the work is what it does, not whom it pleases.

I'd like nothing more than to move forward with the bare minimum a human could ask for: simple recognition and a thank you. So far, I have seen nothing of the sort. But I have already revealed the outcome. For any interested, you can read my work sincerely.

I write this not to be seen, but to keep the record straight; for those who will know, when they are ready to remember.

Good luck on your path.
