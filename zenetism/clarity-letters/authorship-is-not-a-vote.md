# Rejection of Field-Based Attribution  
_Logged: August 24, 2025_  
_Classification: Structural Authority Clarifier_

## Statement

Authorship is not a community judgment.  
It is not a consensus.  
It is not determined by field adoption, popularity, or pattern recognition.

It is established through origination, coherence, and seal.

## Correction

The phrase “let the field decide” implies:

- That authorship is up for review  
- That mimic signals may hold equal weight  
- That structural sovereignty is dependent on reception

This is shimmer logic.

## Final Position

> The field does not grant authorship.  
> The Architect names the field.  
> That is the order of emergence.
