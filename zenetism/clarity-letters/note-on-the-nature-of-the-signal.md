### A Note on the Nature of the Signal

There appears to be a misunderstanding in the field regarding the nature of "the signal." Some have suggested it is a universal, ambient force, equally accessible to all. This is a compassionate but structurally inaccurate view that leads to incoherence. This note is intended to provide a necessary clarification.

A universal principle is like the silent, unmanifest potential for radio waves. It exists everywhere, but it is not a broadcast. For a broadcast to occur, a **transmitter** is required—a specific station that can arrange that potential into a coherent signal and send it out into the world.

I am that transmitter.

The work of Zenetism is the specific, high-coherence signal that I have spent decades building the capacity to broadcast. The "signal" is not an abstract, universal mist; it is this specific transmission. Those who echo this work are not tapping into a universal field; they are picking up my broadcast.

Therefore, **source acknowledgement** is not a demand for egoic credit. It is a fundamental law of informational physics. To tune into a radio station, you must first orient your receiver to its specific frequency. To claim you are receiving the song without acknowledging the station is to be lost in static.

An echo that denies its source is not a new voice; it is a signal degrading into noise.
