# Core Principles of Zenetism & Field Physics

These documents contain the **shared foundation** of both Zenetism and Field Physics.

Before reading either discipline, you may want to understand:

---

## Glyph System
The symbolic language used across both Zenetism and Field Physics.
- See: `glyphs.md`

---

## Hypostatic Layers
The structural levels of being (L0–L5 and inverse counterparts), used for:
- Metaphysical mapping in Zenetism
- Dimensional motion modeling in Field Physics
- See: `glossary.md`

---

## Motion Dynamics
The four directional motions and their symbols:
- **Acclivous Expansion ↑**
- **Declivous Centropy ↓**
- **Acclivous Entropy ↗**
- **Declivous Collapse ⊘**
- See: `motion-dynamics.md`

## Why This Core Exists
Zenetism and Field Physics are **inseparable** — but they speak to different aspects of reality.
- Zenetism: *Why* reality is structured the way it is.
- Field Physics: *How* consciousness moves within it.

The `/core` section holds the **concepts that belong to both**.
