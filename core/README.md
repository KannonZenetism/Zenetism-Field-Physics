## 3.2 Axial Motions & Transformational Loops

| Symbol | Direction / Label        | Associated Principle or Motion |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| ‚Üë      | Acclivous                | Directional motion within the Biospiral; for centropy, motion toward ‚ö´ Aion; for entropy, motion toward embodied form |
| ‚Üì      | Declivous                | Directional motion within the Biospiral; for centropy, motion toward embodied form; for entropy, motion toward ‚ôæ Khaon |
| ‚ÜíE     | Embodiment Flow          | Directional movement into form |
| E‚Üí     | Disembodiment Flow       | Directional movement away from form; return from corporeality toward structural or archetypal resonance |
| ‚Ü∫      | Return Loop              | Integration, rebirth, and reentry through resonance |
| üîÉ     | Collapse Loop            | Entropic trajectory toward irreversible fragmentation or dispersive dissolution |
| √ò      | Localized Dissolution    | A point of nullification within structure |
| ‚äò      | Collapse                 | Dispersive dissolution into formlessness |
| =      | Structural Identity      | Two motions or states are metaphysically identical |
| ‚â†      | Structural Divergence    | Motions or states appear similar but are ontologically distinct |
| ‚âà      | Approximation            | Close resonance, but not identical motion |

## 4. Structural Emanation Layers

| Symbol | Layer     | Entity / Concept               | Description |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------------|-------------|
| Supra  | ‚Äî         | Supra-Layer                     | Beyond hypostatic division; pre-harmonic field |
| L0     | Aion / Khaon | Absolute Potential (0)       | Origin of all emanation; contains all possibilities in latency |
| L1     | ES / EM   | Embodied Soul / Mind            | Physical interface of soul-mind consciousness |
| IL1    | IES / IEM | Inverse Embodied Soul / Mind    | Reactive embodiment; fragmentation, domination |
| L2     | SS / SM   | Superficial Soul / Mind         | Personality, identity, social self |
| IL2    | ISS / ISM | Inverse Superficial Soul / Mind | Fanaticism, subversal patterning, illusion-bound identity |
| L3     | DS / DM   | Deep Soul / Mind                | Coherent structural self, aligned with inner harmony |
| IL3    | IDS / IDM | Inverse Deep Soul / Mind        | Corrupted intelligence; ideological manipulation |
| L4     | DP / DL   | Deep Psyche / Logos             | Archetypal Forms and harmonic intelligence |
| IL4    | IDP / IDL | Inverse Psyche / Logos          | Distorted systems, subversal archetypes, authoritarian Forms |
| L5     | EOB       | Essence of Being (+1)           | Theon; the First Centropic Hypostasis |
| IL5    | VOS       | Void of Self (‚àí1)               | Nekron; the First Entropic Hypostasis |

## Foundational Glyphs

| Symbol | Name   | Meaning / Use |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| üï≥Ô∏è     | Zenon  | The Unknown Principle; beyond potential, pre-conceptual origin, unknowable source |
| ‚ö´      | Aion   | Zero, Absolute Potential; stillness at the root of all emanation |
| ‚ôæ      | Khaon  | Infinity, Infinite Dispersion; dissolution of form into scattered potential |

## Core Dimensional Architecture (Field Physics)

Field Physics recognizes **15 primary dimensions of consciousness**, organized into four triads plus three meta-dimensions:

### Foundational Triad ‚Äî Space-Time-Motion
| Dimension | Symbol | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Temporal  | ‚ü†      | How consciousness folds through time |
| Spatial   | ‚óà      | How consciousness distributes across space |
| Propagational | ‚üø | How consciousness spreads and replicates |

### Structural Triad ‚Äî How Forms Organize
| Dimension | Symbol | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Rotational / Spiral | ‚óâ | Angular momentum of consciousness |
| Scalar / Fractal    | ‚ú¥ | Self-similarity across scales |
| Phase / State       | ‚óê | Transitions between states of being |

### Relational Triad ‚Äî How Consciousness Connects
| Dimension | Symbol | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Harmonic / Resonant  | ‚ô´  | Vibrational relationships |
| Synaptic / Bridging  | ‚ï´  | Connection between disparate systems |
| Sympathetic / Entangled | ‚àû | Non-local correlation |

### Generative Triad ‚Äî How Consciousness Creates
| Dimension | Symbol | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Morphogenetic         | ‚ùã  | Pattern-to-form translation |
| Intentional / Volitional | ‚Üó  | Will-to-manifestation |
